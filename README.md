# nodejs-notes-app
This is my first nodejs project. 
This app do a basic functions like
+ add note
+ remove note
+ list specific notes 
+ list all notes
The input is given through command line.
In this project, I learned to 
+ setup node 
+ use yargs library for arguments fetching 
+ debugging using chrome dev tools
+ using require in node
+ file fetching and modifying 

Hope to learn more..
